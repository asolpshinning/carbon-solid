/**
 * Alluvial, or Sankey diagrams, are a type flow diagram designed to show two indicators of a dataset
 * and how records distribute among them, highlighting correlations. Multiple blocks of two indicators can be placed next
 * to each other creating a wider alluvial diagram but itâ€™s crucial to consider that this specific kind of chart does not
 * show correlations between indicators that are not directly connected. This is usually emphasized using a different set
 * of colors for each block.
