Tree maps can work for visualizing a part-to-whole relationship among a large number of categoriesâ€”as long as the data
is hierarchical and exact comparisons between the categories is not a primary concern.

When dealing with large amounts of data in a constrained space, tree structured nodelink diagrams (like the network
diagram that's the Tree Chart), grow too complex to be useful. Tree maps provide an attractive alternative by
maintaining a hierarchical structure while displaying rectangular quantities for each category
and subcategory via area size.
