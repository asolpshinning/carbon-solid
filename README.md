# Usage (from @asolpshinning)

Working on porting most or all carbon components to solidJS in partnership with my son (8-year old). This will be a good attempt as one of his software engineering training projects.

## What is this? (from @gooddavvy)

This is just a package including some package-testing Solid.js code that is Carbon for Solid.js.

### How to Use (from @gooddavvy)

You might have wondered how to use that Solid.js+TypeScript library. This is actaully easy!

1. Create a new Solid.js app, and make sure it uses TypeScript
2. Navigate to the folder of the app in the terminal, then execute the command: `npx degit asolpshinning/carbon-solid/chartsLibrary`.
3. You can now access these Carbon components from the `chartsLibrary` folder

And that's how to do it!
